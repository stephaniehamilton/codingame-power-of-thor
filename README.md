# codingame-power-of-thor
In this puzzle, you need to compare different values. You have to correlate character variables and integer variables.  A straightforward solution uses 8 conditions. There is a way to simplify it and use only 4 conditions. Your program must allow Thor to reach the light of power. Thor moves on a map which is 40 wide by 18 high. Note that the coordinates (X and Y) start at the top left! This means the most top left cell has the coordinates "X=0,Y=0" and the most bottom right one has the coordinates "X=39,Y=17".
